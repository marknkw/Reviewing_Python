## H2 Reviewing Python: From 0 to Machine Learning
```
	Reviewing Python contents will solidify perception, and general awareness of possible new solutions, 
	and add value to the expertise already built upon 8 years of Python learning.
	As a value, I define its concept as the solidity and understanding scope of progress that can be, 
	and will, be made while reviewing, learning, and developing comprehension of the Python language.
